NBCL, also known as the No Bullsh*t Command Line Parser, is a simple command line parser library for C++ in just two files.

After a great deal of frustration in trying to integrate multiple different command line parser libraries into our Tsunagari Tile Engine (http://tileengine.org/), I decided to write my own. Now, I've decided to split off Tsunagari's parser into a standalone library for general use.

Features:
* The entire library is only two files.
* The library is less than 10kb in size.
* There are no external dependencies.
* No gratuitous configuration is required.
* It's simple to use.
* It's released under the ISC License for maximum freedom.

Planned Features:
* Non-option command line arguments.
